            <p class="about_me">
                Since early on in my life, I had an affinity towards the biological sciences. Part of it was due to family,
                other was my own passion. I worked hard in the sciences but was not able to achieve the status I was looking
                for. Now I am looking at other passions in my life and expanding my horizons.
            </p>

                mBoutique showcases taking a client's idea and bringing it to life as a web page using html, css, and php
                for web page changes. I was given a template design to copy with few only clarifications on color, and
                was provided the images as shown. Given these few ideas, I was able to recreate the design, making it
                mobile-ready and showcasing the ideas given by the client.

                    Memory Match is my first foray into programming in javascript and jquery. The design is based off of
                    the ships of Star Wars. Featured is music, sound effects, difficulty settings, and multiple card sets.
                    On the side bar, you will find instructions on selecting the different card decks and difficulty.
                    With every match, time will be added to the countdown timer. Good luck and stay on target to win.
